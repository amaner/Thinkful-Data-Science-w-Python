# Thinkful 4.2
# Decision Trees

* clean_features.py - cleans features.txt from UCIHAR dataset
* make_y_sets.py - glues together various target sets
* make_x_sets.py - glues together various feature sets
* random_forest_1.py - (for exercises 4.2.3 & 4.2.4) fits a random forest classifier to the training sets, and then tests it (via various sklearn.metrics measures) against the test and validate sets

Note: I used every feature the first time around, so there was no need to go back and change the column labels to x1 ... x561 as recommended in 4.2.4.
