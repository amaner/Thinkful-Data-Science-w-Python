Thinkful 1.3.3

A couple notes:

1) I need to spend some more time thinking about pandas and formatting.  Will do that this weekend.

2) I chose to filter using the query, as opposed to filtering the dataframe.  This seems like the right thing to do, and seems ok as far as the instructions go.

3) I'll spend some time this weekend working on making this dynamic.
